# Ralph Wiggum for AMP

## Requirements

- `amp` installed
- `jq` installed
- `git` installed

## Quick Start

### Standard Initialization

1. Run `./ralph_init.sh`
    - Answer the questions, it will create `prd.json`, `progress.txt` and populate `RULES.md`
    - You can use `--dry-run` or `-d` flag to preview without executing

### Deep Initialization (Large Projects)

For complex projects that need comprehensive task breakdown:

1. Run `./ralph_deep_init.sh`
    - Uses the **Architect-Builder** workflow
    - Creates 6 architectural groups, then expands each into 3-5 tasks
    - Generates larger `prd.json` files through isolated partial files
    - You can use `--dry-run` or `-d` flag to preview

2. Run Ralph: `./ralph.sh`
    - Auto-detects remaining tasks from `prd.json`
    - Executes the autonomous loop

## Configuration

- **ralph.sh** - Iteration count based on non-finished tasks in `prd.json`
- **RULES.md** - Tech stack and coding conventions (auto-generated but editable)
- **prd.json** - Task backlog (generated by init scripts)
